Cargo Survey Analysis
**Role**: UX Researcher
**Time to Complete**: 1 week

The code enclosed here shows the data side of the cargo app case study. This allowed us to design from a data driven perspective and allowed us to tailor our app to address users needs. 
My goals was to clean the data so that we can see any meaningful relationships. Due to time constraints and other responsibilites I wasn't able to conduct the visulizations in R and utlizied Tableau instead.
